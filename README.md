### Project Description
A Chrome extension generator that creates personalized typing speed judges with Malayalam audio commentary. Monitor your typing across ALL websites and get real-time feedback based on your speed - from encouraging praise to hilarious roasts!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever felt like your typing was too peaceful? Missing that judgmental Malayalam uncle/aunty who comments on everything you do? Your keyboard was feeling too quiet and your typing sessions lacked proper cultural commentary! Plus, there was absolutely no way to get unsolicited opinions about your typing speed while browsing the internet.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a Chrome extension generator that monitors your typing speed across ALL websites and plays custom Malayalam MP3 audio files to judge your performance:
- Type slow? Get roasted in Malayalam! üêå
- Type at average speed? Get balanced feedback! ‚öñÔ∏è
- Type fast? Get praised in Malayalam! üöÄ

Because apparently, we needed to add more pressure to our daily typing activities and make every keystroke a performance review!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Libraries:** JSZip 3.10.1 for dynamic extension packaging
- **APIs:** Chrome Extension Manifest V3, Web Audio API, File API
- **Audio Format:** MP3 only for maximum compatibility
- **Frameworks:** Vanilla JavaScript (because sometimes less is more)
- **Tools:** Chrome Developer Tools, Content Script Injection

### Implementation
For Software:

#### Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/AlexJoBobby770/chrome_extension.git]
# Open index.html in any modern browser
# No build process required - pure client-side magic!
```

#### How to Use the Generator
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. **Try the demo first**: Download the sample extension with beep sounds
3. **Create custom version**: 
   - Set your typing speed threshold (Characters Per Second)
   - Upload 3 Malayalam MP3 audio files:
     - Slow typing audio (for roasting)
     - Medium typing audio (neutral feedback)  
     - Fast typing audio (praise)
4. Click "Generate Custom Malayalam Extension"
5. Download the generated ZIP file

#### How to Install Generated Extensions
1. Unzip the downloaded file
2. Open Chrome ‚Üí `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right toggle)
4. Click "Load unpacked" ‚Üí select your unzipped folder
5. Start typing anywhere and get judged! üé≠

### Audio Requirements

## Why This Project is Perfectly Useless Yet Brilliant

### The "Useless" Aspects
1. **Nobody Asked for Typing Judgment**: Yet here we are, adding performance anxiety to every keystroke
2. **Malayalam MP3 Commentary**: Because your typing definitely needed cultural context in high-quality audio
3. **Works on ALL Websites**: Even your private messages get MP3 judgment now - nowhere is safe!
4. **Customizable MP3 Roasting**: Fine-tune exactly how much audio criticism you want while browsing
5. **No Practical Benefit**: Except making typing unnecessarily dramatic with Malayalam MP3s

### The Technical Brilliance
1. **MP3-Only Optimization**: Smart format restriction for maximum compatibility
2. **Universal Compatibility**: Actually works across all major websites without breaking
3. **Real-Time Processing**: Genuinely impressive keystroke analysis and speed calculation
